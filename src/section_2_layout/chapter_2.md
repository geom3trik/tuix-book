# Overview (Grid)

<!-- - **Axis** - refers to either horizontal (row) or vertical (column) directions. Left and right apply to the horizontal axis while top and bottom apply to the vertical axis.
- **Stack** - elements arranged within a parent one after another along an axis.

## Units

All spacing and size properties use the same `Units` enum, which has four variants:

1. **Pixels** - specifies a length pixels
2. **Percentage** - specifies a length as a percentage of the parent length in the same axis (e.g. percentage `left` would be a perctange of the parent width)
3. **Stretch** - specifies the length as a proportion of the free space available.
4. **Auto** - specifies that the length should be automatically determined. This variant has different behaviour depending on the property. -->
