# Child Properies (TODO)


## Position Type
This determines how an element will be positioned within its parent relative to other child elements.

 - **self-directed** - The element determines its own position, relative to the top-left corner of the parent, and is not affected by other elements in a stack or grid.
 - **parent-directed** (default) - The element is positioned by the parent into a stack or grid.

## Spacing
There are four spacing properties that are used to specify the position an element within its parent:

1. left - determines the space to the left of an element.
2. right - determines the space to the right of an element.
3. top - determines the space above an element.
4. bottom - determines the space below an element.

The spacing properties behave somewhat like margins, adding space around an element. 

## Size
The size of an element is determined by two properties:
1. width - determines the width of an element.
2. height - determines the height of an element.

Like with all spacing and size properties, the value can be expressed in pixels, percentage, stretch, and auto.
