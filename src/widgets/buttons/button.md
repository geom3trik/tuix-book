# Button
The button widget provides a control which can respond when pressed or released by the left mouse button.

## Data
The button widget contains an optional text label which can be set with the [`with_label()`](https://docs.rs/tuix/0.2.0/tuix/buttons/struct.Button.html) constructor. 

## Styling
The button widget is composed of a single element (element name: `"button"`) with text.

## Binding
The button widget has no binding data type and thus cannot be bound to any model data.
