# Buttons
Tuix provides a variety of built-in button widgets. 

## Button Types
[Button](../widgets/buttons/button.md) is a basic push button with `on_press` and `on_release` callbacks.

[CheckButton](../widgets/buttons/check_button.md) extends the basic button with `on_checked` and `on_unchecked` callbacks. This widget is useful for things like dropdown and menu items where one or more options can be selected.

[Checkbox](../widgets/buttons/checkbox.md) extends the check button to display a text marker when checked, a tick mark by default.

[Radio](../widgets/buttons/radio.md) is similar to a checkbox, showing a round marker when checked, but is usually used to select a single option from multiple.

[Switch](../widgets/buttons/switch.md) is another kind of widget which can be used to represent a binary option, with a sliding animation for the front marker.
